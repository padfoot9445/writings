PROLOGUE

Sitting upon the bridge of the ISS Manticore, Captain Des Spike mindlessly scrolled past the lastest headlines.

Captain.

Thirty years ago, he would have given anything to be in this position - in command of a supercruiser, out in the middle of nowhere - but that was {startYear} years ago. Then, everyone assured him he had a bright future, that he would make admiral one day - and for a while he {soared?}. He made Lieutenant Commander {x} years ago, then commander, then captain. People still reassured him then; told him that - given the officer-shortage - he’d get a promotion to the admiralty in five or six years. 

That was {y} years ago. He had done nothing of value since; shuttling delegates here and there and cataloguing nebulae - and, sure, that was important, but it wasn’t what he joined the navy for. It wasn’t the constant thrill of discovering new life and new civilisations that those officers that stood on the right side of the admiralty enjoyed. But just because he made one mistake; one error in judgement {y-1} years ago, as a newly promoted captain, he was sidelined; cast aside. //possibly remove ‘cast aside’

In the Cotton massacres, he stood up to his commanding officer, one Admiral {insignificant c.o. Name here}, and refused to fire on walls of civilians who were doing nothing but protesting. And that - officially - was the right choice. Unofficially, howerver, that made him a traitor. That made him someone who could not be trusted; someone who betrayed the naval brotherhood. 

In the years since, he had stood idly by as he watched other officers - some four or five years junior to him - get promoted to flag-rank; get command of various fleets, and doing what he should have been doing - going out there and exploring. But time and again he was passed over. //remove this maybe?

No matter. He was doing his job (charting the {system-name} nebula), and doing it well - even if that did mean reading sensationallist articles about how antimatter usage kills people and how there were(for the second time this month) futile protests about military reform and how warp drive “destabilizes your neuronic energy”.

Leaning back, he sighed in boredom, and closed his eyes.


*

Just over three-hundred light-years away, Admiral {Astelan-char-name} of the Astelans was celebrating his promotion aboard the AS {Astelan-ship-name}.
{IMPORTANT: decribe celebration. He feels tired at the end.}

The comms beeped, jolting him from his half-sleep. He groaned, and with great effort peeled open an eyelid - which saw that his friend, {astelan-friend-char-name} was going to get it.

The eyelid fell shut.


CHAPTER ONE
Six hours later, {Astelan-char-lastname} stepped onto the bridge - dimming his visor as he did(he had a head-splitting migrane) - and was greeted by complete chaos.

Clearly, something had happened. He remembered - vaguely - that someone had tried to reach him last night. But - no, that simply couldn’t be related - they would have tried harder - wouldn’t they?

He took a deep breath, and strode calmly to the center of the bridge.

<Report.>

The bridge fell silent. In every person’s mind, he sensed fear, nervousness, and a sense of disbelief; a sense of hoping that someone else would speak up.
Of course, no-one did.

He turned to his science officer(she feared nothing, and was always commited to integrity and the scientific truth), but to his surprise he found that even she was uneasy.

<{Astelan-science-officer-name} - what the hell is going on?>

She snapped to attention - again, odd: [CHANGE WORDING: in an effort to reduce tension when he was a new captain, he had made it so that attention was not neccesary]
<Sir, there is an inbound vessel. Initial measurements put its speed at an approximate [very high speed], and we’ve - well, we’ve just confirmed it is travelling at [more precise vh speed].>

<Impossible - even we do not have ships that fast - let alone the rest of the cluster. The sensors must be broken!>

<That’s what i thought too, sir; but we’ve already checked and recalibrated the sensors.>

[Very high speed] was impossible. He knew that - everyone knew that. No current technology, nor even any theoretical technologies, considered that speed to be remotely achievable, even for weapons. But a ship, of all things, achieving that speed? That was simply absurd.

Nonetheless, it seemed that the impossible - in this case - was possible.

He took a deep breath.
<Ensign {ensign-name}, bring me a - >What was the word? Ah, yes - <Coffee, please.>
Coffee, being the exotic Icaran drink that it was, was expensive. But if he ever deserved coffee, it was now.

He paced, trying to clear his head. {ensign-name} brought him the Coffee; he drank it.
<Contact the {Carrier-name}. Ask them to verify and deploy scouts, deploy a level-two screening field with a tempoary screen and minefield blockade on our position; and then prepare to retreat to standard ready positions.>

“Captain Spike, we’re recieving an urgent inbound message.”

“Put it on.”

“It’s text-only, sir. Its from one of our frigates, the {frigate-name}, which was escorting a cargo convoy. They’ve been attacked by a {pirate-faction}-ship, and while they have scared it off have taken considerable damage. Appearantly, it is headed in our direction at - and I quote: ‘Impossible speeds’, and {frigate-name} requests we intercept it.”

“Reply with acknowledgement. Conn, sound General Quarters and plot an intercept course. Tactical, work with [replace: Astrology] and prepare a brief of the area of intercept and the enemy ship.“


Chapter Two - two hours later - spike.

Captain Spike - now dressed in full armor - strode towards the automatic doors of the briefing room.

He still couldn’t believe what was happening. Yes - the frigate being attacked was regrettable, but for once he was where the action was; for once, he had something important to do - even if it was a simple anti-piracy one.

As he stepped towards the doors, he stretched out his hand - the microchipped gauntlet transmitted his access code - the doors opened.

“Report.”

His executive officer, commander {XO-name-here}, replied. “Captain, we have confirmed the vessel to be similar to a {pirate-ship-class}. Assuming we depart at maximum speed in one hour, we will be intercepting them in quardrant five of this system at four O' clock - three hours later - which is ideal: it is devoid of asteroids. We have also confirmed the {frigate-name}’s report of the vessel travelling at an ‘impossible speed’: It is - in-fact - travelling at appoximately {VH}.”

“But…who even has engines of this class?”

“No-one, sir. That’s why it’s impossible.”

The room fell silent, as the officers gathered waited for that information to sink into Spike’s mind, and for him to give instructions.

That took a while. But, eventually, he spoke.

“Commander, proceed with the departure in…” Spike checked his watch. “Twenty-four minutes. Engage cloak and sound yellow alert, and inform me when we arrive.
Turning on his heel, he left the room, grinning to himself - finally, something exiting was happening!
*One hour and twenty-four minutes later
Captain Spike - now fully awake and refreshed - sat on the bridge, staring(along with everyone else)at the red dot darting towards them, as {XO-last-name-here}gave updates on its ETA.

"Ten minutes!"
"Commander, order General Quarters," said Spike.{XO-last-name-here} did so, and immediately the bridge was bathed in red light.

"Five!”
“Load torpedo tubes!”

“Four!”
“Engage shields.”

“Three.”

“Two.”

“One.”

“Zero.”

On the Manticore, every man and woman - whether officer, crewman, or civilian - waited with baited breath, as a bright-blue dot of plasma appeared in-front of the ship.

The dot grew, expanding first into a ball, then a rift - and out of the rift came the {pirate-ship-class}-class vessel, Vengeance.

Vengance, Spike thought to himself. That was certainly an appropiate name.

Tapping into his years of training, Spike began to give orders.

“Hail them.”
“No response, sir.”
“Fire a warning-shot, one-hundred milimeters.”

With a low rumble, and a flash of blue, a swirling ball of plasma one-hundred milimeters in diameter erupted from the Manticore’s secondary cannon, leaving a faint trail of blue gas behind as it flew towards the Vengeance.

The Vengance’s engines pulsed. With a flash of red light, it began to accelerate.

The ball of plasma twinkled off into the distance.

“Captain, the Vengance is charging weapons. Permission to fire?”
“Granted. Fire main cannons, and engage full reverse thrust.”

With another(louder) rumble, the Manticore’s main cannons - twin two-hundred milimeters - fired, leaving behind yet another faint cloud of smoke. 

Simultaneously, two streaks of scarlet light blasted out from the Vengeance’s
cannons. They rushed towards the Manticore, and with a sickening - almost corrisive - crunch, passed through the Manticore's bubble-sheilding as if it did not exist, and impacted directly on the symbiotic sheild with a loud rumble[clang?].

"Impact on Section Ten, dorsal!" cried the Lieutenant manning the tactical station.

"Damage?"

"Structural capability on the plating reduced to roughly sixty percent, sir!"

Spike took a deep breath. Sixty was certainly lower than anything he had ever seen, but not impossible. There was still a chance.

"Fire all tubes; spread: delta!"

With a clunk the doors protecting the torpedo bays opened, and within seconds the missiles and torpedoes poured out. Hydra-type missiles acted as decoys;  Scorpion-cluster munitions deployed their charges in beautiful concentric patterns, sheilding the Impact torpedoes from any interceptor fire; and...

"Hit!"
The room erupted in cheers.

Spike exhaled, smiling. Time to finish them off.

Suddenly, an alarm sounded.

"Hull breach, Section Ten, dorsal!"

"Lieutenant, I thought you said there was still about sixty percent Structrual integrity?"

"There...well, there was!"

"Nevermind. Seal off the breach, and fire another spread. Maintain a constant bombardment with main cannons."

"Yes, sir."

The missiles fired, silently this time. Spike let the constant thump of the cannons drown out all the other noise.

What happened to the remaining sixty percent?

Another flash of scarlet; another sickening crunch. Spike looked up.

"Sir, they hit us in the same spot!"

Impossble. Completely absurd. Not even Astelan ships - let alone a {pirate-faction} one - were so precise at the edge of engagement range. No, that was just sheer luck - it had to be.

"Well?"

"Ten dead, sir. Internal bulkheads 120-B and 121-C completely vaporised; major structural damage to sections ten and eleven; and structural integrity of deck ten is compromised."

"Conn, rotate us twelve degrees to starboard - hopefully, that should stop them from fireing at that same spot again. What about the Vengeance?"

"We're nearly through her port shielding, sir."

"Conn, what about our distance?"

"Distance: {distance}. We're closing at {dv}."

"Tactical, status?"

"Hold on - hit, sir! We've destroyed their portside cannon! As for damage: We've lost our secondary cannon. We've also recieved damage to sections twelve and five - but for now, its minimal."

"Target the other cannon with our cannons. Keep the missiles aimed at port - they should do some proper damage now that there aren't any shields in the way. "

Another flash of scarlet; another rumble; another who-knows-how-many dead. His heart ached at the thought of those loyal officers dying; at the thought of his ship being hurt by pirates - but they were close to victory. He could feel it.

"We've taken out their starboard sheilds!"

Spike waited with baited breath. He had - while there was nothing to do - trained his officers; implemented plans and taught them how to react. Now, there was very little he could do except sit, wait, and hope that their training was enough. The intercom was ablaze with voices, ordering damage-control to various compartments.

The Manticore was twice the size of the Vengance. Surely - even with whatever inane technology the Vengance had - that would be enough?

"We've hit their other cannon - they're accelerating!"
Spike looked up. The Vengeance was already at light-speed, so accelerating would put it faster-than-light - and any schoolchild could tell you that going FTL this close to a gravity well was impossible. He chuckled, derisively[dryly] - after today, likely nothing would surprise him.
"Damage?"
"Damage to bow torpedo bay, and starboard cannon. We've evacuated the front section of the ship."

"Keep firing," Spike replied. "Plot a pursuit course - we're going after them."

{astelan-char-name}

<Admiral, the vessel is accelerating. It appears to be damaged. We've also detected an Icaran ship pursuing it - the ISS Manticore, sir. It is also heavily damaged.>

<But the Manticore is - >
<Twice its size, yes, sir.>
<Is it still headed for us?>
<Yes, sir. It doesn't seem to have detected us yet - perhaps its sensors were damaged in the battle.>
<Charge the spinal battery, and have the {Carrier-name} deploy a combat-wing. I want to know what the hell that ship's engines look like.>

Chapter Four - One hour later.

{astelan-char-name}
The energy on the bridge was tense. Each and every officer felt nervous - and, this time, {astelan-char-last-name} joined them in that nervousness. Whatever that ship was, it was powerful - the state of the Manticore proved that.

<Admiral, the vessel is entering the system now.>

The ball of plasma materialized; the rift appeared. And to the delight of every one of Admiral {astelan-char-last-name}'s crew, the Vengeance flew - at top speed - straight into the Astelan minefield. 

The mines ripped it apart. After it had stopped as a result of the opposing force of the mine-explosions(taking an incredible fifteen twenty-kilogram fusion mines to do so), there was nothing left but debris.

The bridge-crew stared in shock and disbelief.

Finally, Admiral {astelan-char-last-name} spoke.
<Send a science-crew to recover whatever's left - if there's anything more than debris, which is doubtful - and have the {carrier-name} clear the minefield.>

Spike
Two-and-a-half hours later, the ISS Manticore - damaged, but alive - warped into the Astelans' system.

"Captain, the Astelans - be careful. We don't want to start another war."

"I know, Commander, but we have as much claim to the wreckage as they do - arguably more. Besides, I'm not leaving until i've seen those cannons and those engines. How's the ship?"

"Repairs are underway, sir. And, we've uncovered some information about whatever the Vengeance shot at us."

Spike looked up, surprised.
"Oh?"
"Damage control uncovered some sort of corrosive on the bulkhead; nothing we've ever seen before. It appears to be psionic, sir - on section ten, for instance, they couldn't even get close to the breach: they all felt too dizzy to. But what samples we have indicate an extremely powerful corrosive, somehow able to damage things it isn't even physically touching; it only requires that the item itself is physically connected to another material it is touching. We've ejected most of it now, sir; it simply wasn't safe to store in contact with even the air - but we've kept a few samples in one of the antimatter-contaiment chambers."

Spike gave him a slight, warm smile.
"Good job, Commander."
He smiled back.
"Thank you, sir."
"Hail the Astelans, and announce our intention to participate in the salvage."
Leaning back, Spike braced himself for the response.

{astelan-char-last-name}'s response came quickly.

With a faint glow from their projection-dish, a psionic wave rolled out from the Astelan ship, AS {astelan-ship-name}. It intersected the Manticore, filling everyone in its path with a slight sense of warmth. Methodically, it leapt from mind-to-mind, searching for Captain Spike.

Admiral {astelan-char-last-name}'s response echoed in Spike's head, making him feel a sense of warmth - but yet, at the same time, a sense of being small: a sense of being but a cog in the universe's workings; a pawn in some grand game of chess.

He fought the feeling off.

<You are welcome to...participate, Captain - but I think you'll find we've got most of the things already.> /s

Idiots.

"Commander, assemble a science-team. There'll be no need for security precautions - as much as our friends/s might not want us to find anything, they don't want a war either. For now, we're safe here."
*
Spike - two hours later.

Captain Spike in his quarters, nursing a cup of coffee. He had been awake for nearly twelve hours now, and about to go to bed - but he wanted to see what came of the salvage-team.

The doorbell rung. Spike looked over at the clock: Seven fifty-five. Right on time.
With a wave of his hand, he opened the door.
"Commander {xo-name}! Come in. How are the repairs - and the salvage -  going?"

"We've successfully restored the outer-hull to airtight condition. As for the Vengeance, like the Astelans said, not much was left. But, we did recover part of their navigation log."

"Well - what does it say?"

"That's the thing, sir. Its encrypted - probably why the Astelans didn't take it as well. They probably thought it was corrupted, but Ensign Jones recognized the pattern from one of our classified files"

Spike chuckled, dryly.
"I guess all of the hours he spent daydreaming, and reading up on old missions paid off."

"I guess so."

Spike leaned forwards.
"Do you think we'll get anything else, commander?"
